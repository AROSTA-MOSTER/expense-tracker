## Steps to Complete:

1.  **Set Up React TypeScript Project**
    *   Initialize a React project with TypeScript.
    *   Install dependencies including Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Create Components**
    *   `ExpenseForm.tsx`: Handles user input.
    *   `ExpenseList.tsx`: Displays recorded expenses.
    *   `ExpenseTracker.tsx`: Manages the app's state.
3.  **Implement State Management using React Hooks**
    *   Use `useState` for managing expense data.
    *   Use `useEffect` to sync data with localStorage.
4.  **Handle Storage with localStorage/IndexedDB**
    *   Save and retrieve expenses from localStorage.
    *   (Optional) Implement IndexedDB for advanced storage.
5.  **Style with Tailwind CSS**
    *   Apply responsive design principles.
    *   Ensure a clean and minimalistic user interface.
6.  **Test and Debug**
    *   Ensure data persistence and smooth interactions.
    *   Validate user inputs to prevent errors.

## Optional Bonus Features:

*   **Group Expenses by Category or Date:** Add functionality that groups expenses by either category or date, and display them grouped in the UI.
*   **Visualize Data with Charts:** Create a chart (using a library like Chart.js) to visually represent expenses. This could be a pie chart showing expenses broken down by category or a bar chart showing daily or monthly expenses.
*   **Edit and Delete Functionality:** Allow users to edit or delete individual expenses from the list. Update the total dynamically if an expense is deleted.

## Deliverables:

*   A functional React TypeScript expense tracker.
*   Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
*   Persistent storage via localStorage/IndexedDB.
*   A GitHub repository with clean, documented code.

## Evaluation Criteria:

*   Proper React & TypeScript implementation.
*   Efficient state management using React hooks.
*   Correct use of localStorage or IndexedDB.
*   Clean and responsive UI with Tailwind CSS.
*   Fully working add, delete, and update expense features.
